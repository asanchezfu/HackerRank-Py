# Python Division Challenge

This code has been developed for the Python Division challenge.

The provided code stub reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, `a // b`.
The second line should contain the result of float division, `a / b`.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

## Example

```python
a = 3
b = 5
```
